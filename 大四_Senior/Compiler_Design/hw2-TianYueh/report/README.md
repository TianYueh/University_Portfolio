## How much time did you spend on this project

> About 4 hours

## Project overview

> First, I modified the scanner.l file to make it return the keywords or data types that we need to use in parser.y.
Second, in the parser file, I added grammar rules for it to parse. I follow the rules given in the spec.
Finally, when we have a .p file, we can use the scanner to read the syntax, and then use the parser to parse them according to the given rules.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

This assignment is relatively easy. What we need to do is add return statements in the scanner and write the grammar rules in the parser according to the spec.
I would say that handling some situations, like "at least one" and "zero or more" are a little bit challenging, but still.

## Feedback to T.A.s

Thank you for creating the assignments! It's inspiring to see that we can gradually do a more things to the .p files.
I hope that I'm still able to deal with the following assignments, which is said to be quite difficult and require a lot of time :(.
