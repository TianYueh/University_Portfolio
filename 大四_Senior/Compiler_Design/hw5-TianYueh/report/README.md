## How much time did you spend on this project

About 12 hours.

## Project overview

In this project, we implement the CodeGenerator for P language to translate it and dump the RISC-V instructions. The parser traverses through the nodes like in HW4, and perform instructions dumping or status changing during the traversal, until all the nodes are visited and the needed instructions are dumped.  
In this project, we also need some parameters, flags or variables to record the current status or address, and perform dumping according to it.  

## What is the hardest you think in this project

This project is relatively easier compared to the previous two projects because the assembly code we need to dump are mostly written in the spec or can be found on the internet.  
However, we still need to maintain a lot of flags, and we need to get acquainted to the assembly language to make all the thing in order.  
The most difficult part would still be debugging, just a miss of adjustment of address might lead to infinite loops or the eventual failure of the final results.  

## Feedback to T.A.s

I would like to express my gratitude for you for the whole semester, including giving use the assignments, grading our the assignments and exam papers, etc. This is a difficult work, so thank you!  
Wish you a nice upcoming future!
