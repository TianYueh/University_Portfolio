## How much time did you spend on this project

About 3 hours.

## Project overview

In this project, we modify scanner.l to do lexical analysis. First, we define the regular expressions for the elements, such as digits, numbers, and something even more complicated like string.
Second, we define the actions to do when encountering the elements, such as listing, discarding them, or changing their states.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

The hardest part is to think of the regular expression, and to deal with some complicated elements such as strings. I encountered some errors when dealing with the regular expressions of strings in the advanced testcases. 
Also I didn't notice that for some elements like space or end of line, we just need to use {} to ignore them, so I encountered some errors like having an extra end of line. 

## Feedback to T.A.s

Thank you for designing this homework, that's interesting!
